## Von Neumann vs Harvard
- **Princeton (Von Neumann) Architecture**
	- All memory space on same bus
	- Every location has unique address
	- So instructions and data treated the same way
		- Possible bottleneck between instruction and data fetches
		- Overcome with instruction prefetching (overlapping, pipelining) and/or
	- Simplifies processor design -- one memory interface
		- More reliable -- fewer things can fail
	- Also RAM can be used for both data and instruction storage
		- Greater flexibility in design of software
	- PC (80x86/Pentium) uses this architecture
- **Harvard Architecture**
	- Code and data storage areas on separate buses
	- Potentially more efficient
		- Instructions execute in fewer cycles
		- Greater instruction parallelism is possible
		- Instructions and data fetched simultaneously (new instruction fetches can occur during prior instruction execution)

## Pipelining 
- Is a technique used to increase the instruction throughput (the number of instructions that can be executed in a unit of time)

## RISC and CISC Processors 
- CISC ( Complex Instruction Set Computers )
	- Tend to have many instruction in instruction set
	- Can carry out complex operations
		- (many used very infrequently)
	- Many are very long (many bits)
	- And require many clock cycles
	- System/360, VAX, PDP-11, Motorola 68000 family, and Intel x86 architecture based processors
- RISC ( Reduced Instruction Set Computers)
	- Few instructions
	- Simple instructions
	- Short (few bits) and fast
	- Often orthogonal instruction sets
		- Can read/write/use all registers in same way
		- Allows for great power and flexibility
	- Alpha, ARC, ARM, AVR, MIPS, PA-RISC, PIC, Power Architecture (including PowerPC), SuperH, and SPARC

## Design of Control Unit
- Control unit generates timing and control signals for the operations of the computer. The control unit communicates with ALU and main memory. It also controls the transmission between processor, memory and the various peripherals. It also instructs the ALU which operation has to be performed on data.
- Control unit can be designed by two methods
	- Hardwired Control Unit
	- Microcoded/Microprogrammed

## Microcoded versus Hardwired processors
- Microcoded 
	- Processor within a processor
	- Signals required to execute instructions "fetched" from internal "Control ROM " memory
	- Allows for great flexibility in instruction set
	- Easier to design
	- Slower than hardwired
- Hardwired
	- Signals required to execute instruction generated by logic gates
		- The control matrix
	- Faster
	- Less Flexible

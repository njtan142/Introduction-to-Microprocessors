- MP - suited to processing information in computer systems
- MC - suited to control I/O devices requiring a minimum of component count


Instructions sets:
- MP:
	- processing intensive
	- powerful addressing modes
	- instructions to perform complex operations & manipulate large volumes of data
	- processing capability of MCs never approaches those of MPs
	- large instructions , e.g. 80x86 7-bit long instructions


Bus widths:
- MP:
	- very wide
	- large memory adderss spaces (>4GB)
	- lots of data
- MC: 
- narrow 
- relatively small

Clock rates:
- MP
	- Very fast

Cost:
- MP:
	- Expensive
- MC:
	- cheap

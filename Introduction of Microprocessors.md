- First invented by the company led by Gordan Moore and Robert Noyce in 1968 (from Fairchild semiconductor company and start-up Intel)
- The first microprocessor like Intel 4004 was invented by Ted Hoff, Masatoshi Shima, Federico Faggin, and Stanley Mazor
- Marcian Edward "Ted" Hoff, a young scientist at Intel, was assigned to work with minicomputers and in June 1968. Join a group of Japanese engineers from a company called Busicom. They'd approached intel with a design for a small calculator
- Hoff felt that programming through read-only memory and general purpose registers could replace the separate components the Busicom engineers had requested
- Federico Faggin, took him 9 months  to turn Hoff's ideas into hardware while Mazor helped define the architecture and instruction set for the revolutionary new chip

## What is a microprocessor?
- Is the integration of a number of useful functions into a single IC package
- The functions are:
	- Execute a stored set of instructions to carry out user defined tasks
	- Access external memory chips to both read and write data from and to the memory
	- Interface with I/O devices

Components of the microprocessor
- Components of this processor are ALU, Control Unit, Input-output devices, and register array
	- ALU
- The register array consists of registers. Registeres that are used by the probrammer to store arbitrary data are known as general0purpose registers and the registers which are not used by a programmer to store the data are known as the reserved registers. The length of the register is known as the 


Evolution of Microprocessors
- First Generation (4-bit Microprocessors)
- The first generation microprocessors were introduced in the year 1971-1972 by Intel Corporation. It was named Intel 4004 since it was a 40bit processor.
- It was a processor on a single chip. it could perform simple arithmetic and logical operations such as Addition, Subtraction, Boolean OR and Boolean AND.
- I had a control unit capable of performing control functions like fetching and instruction from storage memory, decoding it, and then generating control pulses to execute it. 
- Second generation ( 8 - bit Microprocessor )
- The second generation microprocessors wwere introduced in 1973 again by Intel. It was a first 8 - bit microprocessor which could perform arithmetic and logic operations on 8-bit words. It was Intel 8008 and another improved version was 8088
- Third Generation (16-bit Microprocessor)
- Thethrigd generation microprocessors introducted in 1978, 80856


Working of Microprocessor
- follows a sequence to execute the instructin, fetch, Decode, and then Execute.
- Initially, the instructions are stored in the storage memory of the computer in sequential order. The microprocessor fetches those instructions from the stored area, then decodes it and executes those instructions till STOP instruction is met. Then it sends
